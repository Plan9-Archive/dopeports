dopeports -- tools to deal with ports

installation
	run dpinstaller. dp is normally installed to /rc/bin/dopeports

configuration
	By default dp will look for it's stuff in /bin/dopeports, use the
	ports tree at /sys/ports, and will install ports for arm, amd64,
	and 386.  If you need to configure any of this take the example
	config file, edit it, and place it at either /lib/dopeports.conf
	or $home/lib/dopeports.conf.

dopeports/install [ports...]
	This program takes a list of ports and installs them for
	$targetarches.

dopeports/uninstall [ports...]
	Same as install, but uninstalls the ports.

dopeports/status
	Gives you a rough estimate of what ports need updating.

dopeports/update
	Takes the list of ports from status and updates them by first uninstalling a port then reinstalling the port for all architectures.

other files
	getname.awk extracts the port name from the ndb database
	dplib.rc contains helper functions used by dp.
	dpinstaller installs dp
